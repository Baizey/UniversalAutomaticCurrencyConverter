## Conversion at all cost

Currency converters can act in 1 of 3 ways:

- Carefully, searches in invididual text nodes, replaces in individual text nodes, Likely to miss currencies, never breaks websites.

- Aggressively, searches across html tags and replaces across html tags. Likely to find all currencies, might break websites.

- Intelligently, searches aggressively, but replaces carefully. Likely to find all currencies, never breaks websites.

Most currency conversion extensions will likely act carefully. This extension currently acts intelligently.
